The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant, k, to be 1.380 649 × 10^−23 when expressed in J K^−1, which is equal to kg m^2 s^−2 K^−1, where the kilogram, meter, and second are defined in terms of h, c, and ∆νCs.
