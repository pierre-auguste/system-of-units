The speed of light, denoted as "c," is a fundamental physical constant that represents the velocity at which electromagnetic waves, including visible light, propagate through a vacuum.

This universal speed limit was elucidated by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which he introduced in 1905.

In the International System of Units (SI), the speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second. One meter is the distance traveled by the light in one second divided by 299,792,458.
